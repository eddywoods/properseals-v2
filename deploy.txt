How do i go about with configuring Kannel such that:
incoming messages come to Kannel and then get forwarded to Mircrosoft APIs which are processed and subsequently the results are sent back to Kannel via a URL that kannel automatically generates for outgoing messages


Create a sample kannel configuration and how to setup an SMSC (SMS center) connection


Here's a sample Kannel configuration file (kannel.conf) with an SMSC connection setup:


group = core
admin-port = 13000
admin-password = secret
log-file = "/var/log/kannel/kannel.log"

group = smsc
smsc = dummy
smsc-id = dummy-smsc
dummy-status-report-mask = 15
dummy-receive-msg-mask = 15

group = modems
id = modem1
name = "Modem 1"
port = /dev/ttyUSB0
my-number = +12023041208
speed = 115200
smsc = dummy-smsc

group = sendsms-user
username = test
password = test

group = smsbox
bearerbox-host = localhost
sendsms-port = 13013
global-sender = 13013




Explanation:

group = core: This section sets up the core configuration options for Kannel.
admin-port and admin-password: This sets the port and password for the Kannel administrative interface.
log-file: This sets the location of the Kannel log file.
group = smsc: This section sets up the configuration for the SMS center connection.
smsc: This sets the type of SMSC connection. In this example, it's set to dummy, which means that Kannel will simulate an SMSC connection for testing purposes.
smsc-id: This sets the unique identifier for the SMSC connection.
dummy-status-report-mask and dummy-receive-msg-mask: These options are specific to the dummy SMSC and set the type of messages that it will receive and generate.
group = modems: This section sets up the configuration for a modem connection.
id, name, port, my-number, speed, and smsc: These options set the identifier, name, port, phone number, speed, and SMSC connection for the modem.
group = sendsms-user: This section sets up the credentials for sending SMS messages.
username and password: This sets the username and password for sending SMS messages.
group = smsbox: This section sets up the configuration for the SMS box, which is responsible for receiving and forwarding SMS messages.
bearerbox-host: This sets the hostname or IP address of the machine running the bearerbox.
sendsms-port and global-sender: These options set the port for sending SMS messages and the global sender number, respectively.







How do i go about with configuring Kannel such that:
incoming messages come to Kannel and then get forwarded to an api from another organization which are processed and subsequently the results are sent back to Kannel via a URL that kannel automatically generates for outgoing messages



Here's how you can configure Kannel to forward incoming messages to an API from another organization and send the results back to Kannel via an automatically generated URL:

Set up a Kannel instance and configure it to receive incoming SMS messages.

Create a script or program that formats the incoming messages in a way that the API from the other organization can understand and process.

Call the API from the other organization using the script or program and retrieve the results.

Use the Kannel API to send the results back to Kannel and forward them to the recipient.

Here's an example in Python:



import requests

# API endpoint from the other organization
api_endpoint = "https://api.example.com/process"

# Kannel incoming message
incoming_message = "Hello, I need assistance."

# Prepare the API request header
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

# Prepare the API request body
data = {
    "message": incoming_message
}

# Make the API request
response = requests.post(api_endpoint, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))

# Check if the API request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the API response
    api_response = response.json()

    # Get the processed message from the API response
    processed_message = api_response['message']

    # Use Kannel API to send the processed message back to Kannel
    # ...

else:
    # Log the error
    # ...






How do i deploy the above on ubuntu server using nginx




Here are the steps to deploy the above script on an Ubuntu server using Nginx:

1. Install Nginx and Python:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx python3 python3-pip


2. Install the requests library:
pip3 install requests


3. Create a new directory to store the script:

mkdir ~/kannel-forwarder


4. Create a new script file and paste the code:

nano ~/kannel-forwarder/forwarder.py


5. Make the script executable:

chmod +x ~/kannel-forwarder/forwarder.py


6. Configure Nginx to run the script as a reverse proxy. Create a new Nginx server block:

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/kannel-forwarder


7. Add the following content to the Nginx server block:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name forwarder.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}



8. Create a symbolic link from the Nginx sites-available to sites-enabled directory:

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/kannel-forwarder /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/


9. Test the Nginx configuration:

sudo nginx -t


10. Restart Nginx if the configuration test is successful:

sudo systemctl restart nginx


11. Start the script in the background using a process manager such as screen or nohup:

screen -d -m python3 ~/kannel-forwarder/forwarder.py


12. Configure Kannel to send incoming messages to the Nginx server.

With these steps, the script will be running on the Ubuntu server behind Nginx and will be accessible via the domain name forwarder.example.com. Kannel can be configured to send incoming messages to the Nginx server, and the script will forward the messages to the API from the other organization and send the results back to Kannel.



Create Kannel configuration to send incoming messages to the Nginx server from the above steps


Here is a sample Kannel configuration to send incoming messages to the Nginx server:

1. Open the Kannel configuration file:

nano /etc/kannel/kannel.conf


2. Add the following configuration:

group = smsbox
smsbox-port = 13001
smsbox-route = http://forwarder.example.com


3. Save and close the file.

4. Restart Kannel to apply the changes:

sudo systemctl restart kannel

With this configuration, Kannel will listen on port 13001 for incoming messages and will forward them to the Nginx server running on the domain forwarder.example.com. The script running on the server will process the messages and send the results back to Kannel.




Create a bash script for doing all the above


Here is a bash script that automates the steps for deploying the forwarder script on an Ubuntu server using Nginx:




#!/bin/bash

# Install Nginx and Python
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx python3 python3-pip -y

# Install the requests library
pip3 install requests

# Create a new directory to store the script
mkdir ~/kannel-forwarder

# Create a new script file and paste the code
cat > ~/kannel-forwarder/forwarder.py << EOF
import requests
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def forward():
    message = request.form['message']
    sender = request.form['sender']
    # Forward the message to the API from the other organization
    response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/sms', json={'message': message, 'sender': sender})
    # Return the response from the API
    return response.text

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
EOF

# Make the script executable
chmod +x ~/kannel-forwarder/forwarder.py

# Configure Nginx to run the script as a reverse proxy
sudo cat > /etc/nginx/sites-available/kannel-forwarder << EOF
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name forwarder.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host \$host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP \$remote_addr;
    }
}
EOF

# Create a symbolic link from the Nginx sites-available to sites-enabled directory
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/kannel-forwarder /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# Test the Nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Restart Nginx if the configuration test is successful
sudo systemctl restart nginx

# Start the script in the background using screen
screen -d -m python3 ~/kannel-forwarder/forwarder.py

# Configure Kannel to send incoming messages to the Nginx server
sudo cat > /etc/kannel/kannel.conf << EOF
group = smsbox
smsbox-port = 13001
smsbox-route = http://forwarder.example.com
EOF

# Restart Kannel to apply the changes
sudo systemctl restart kannel




This script will install Nginx and Python, install the requests library, create the forwarder script, configure Nginx as a reverse proxy, start the script in the background, and configure Kannel to send incoming messages to the Nginx server. You can run this script on an Ubuntu server to automate the deployment process.
